# Javascript Password Generator

## Description

I Needed a way to come up with a random password to make the password unique from my normal ones. So with some assistance from a starter code I got it done so that I can make as simple or as complex of a password as I wanted. This web page really saves me the time and energy needed to come up with a password with the added bonus that it's randomized making it more unique from my other passwords all from javascript. I learned to get more comfortable with If statements and functions helping me enjoy basic javascript more. The hardest part in my opinion was the randomizer, but everything ended up working out in the end.
